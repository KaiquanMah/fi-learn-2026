* To understand
  * the project, please read `markdown.md`
  * instructions on how to run the app locally or to deploy on a hosting service such as Vercel, please read `markdown.md section ## 9. Deployment Guide`
  * The curriculum was researched by `gemini-3-pro-preview` in AI Studio, visit `data/curriculum.ts` and `data/curriculum.md`
    * The words and sentences found in the curriculum were used to generate a corresponding audio/mp3 file using `Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API (enabled in my Google Cloud Platform project)`
    * The mp3 files are stored in the `public/audio` folder, with file naming convention: `{finnish word or sentence}.mp3`
* 3-minute demo video for the 2026.01.10 Saturday - SG Gemini Hackathon
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjYpcIp_nRQ
* Inspiration for the website/app came from
  1. my recent overseas travels where I needed to learn some basic words and sentences to navigate better
  2. me registering for an introductory Finnish language lesson from Jan 2026 to May 2026 - so it would help other students or people new to Finland
